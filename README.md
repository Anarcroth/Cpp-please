## Overview
Hi!

You've stumbled upon my repository of C++ topics. Here I talk about topics like *"How to structure your program, How compilation works, What are some good practices when writing C++"*, etc. Although the list of topics is way too big, I do try to cover as much as possible in it. The purpose of all of this is to help students who are starting off with the language, or either have some basic experience, in order to help them minimize their C++ suffering. The topics I've chosen are the ones which are most commonly confusing when writing C++.

The resources I've gathered and used to write all of these tutorials is mentioned at *the end* of every tutorial. In addition, I've also greatly relied on the books *Effective C++* and *Effective STL* by Scott Meyers and on the *C++ 11 standard*. The programming tasks and exercises are taken either from various exercising books or from [daily programmer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/).

The slides also have a corresponding `pdf` version, where all of the notes are available for reading.
