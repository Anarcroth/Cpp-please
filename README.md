# C++ - a more in depth look into the language

## Overview
Hi!
You've stumbled on my repository for C++ topics. Here I try to talk about topics like "How to structure your program, How compilation works, What are some good practices when writing C++", etc. Although the list is way too big, I do try to cover as much as possible. The purpose of all of this is to help students who are starting of with the language, or either have some basic experience, in order to help them minimize their C++ suffering. I've stopped on these (for now), because they are the ones which are most commonly confusing when writing C++.

The resouces I've gathered and used to write all of these tutorials is mentioned at *the end* of every tutorial. In addition, I've also greately relied to the book *Effective C++ 3ed.* by Scott Meyers. The programming tasks and exercises are taken either from various books or from [daily programmer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/).

The `html`s also have a corresponding `pdf` version, in which all of the notes are available for reading.
